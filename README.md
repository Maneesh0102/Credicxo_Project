# Credicxo_Project
I completed the project using BeautifulSoup4 
Firstly using pandas I imported the .csv file to my window and then managed to generate the amazon links.
To access the amazon websites some headers had been added and using requests I gathered html file of page
Now using some conditions seperated the working links and the links which are showing errors
For working links using bs4 some information like name,price,image url and description of the product arecollect and stored in json file
